      "summary": "The UK government needs to go beyond offering subsidies for low-carbon technologies (LCTs) like electric cars and solar panels for energy and heating, if it is to meet its net-zero targets by 2050, a new report from the University of Sheffield suggests. The report, published with partners from the universities of Nottingham and Macedonia, found that although gains are being made in encouraging people to adopt low-carbon technologies, not enough is being done to continue to reduce the inequalities in uptake amongst some socioeconomic groups. In recent years households using solar panels for electricity generation has increased from 3 to 6.5 per cent, the adoption of solar panels being used for heating increased from 1.4 to 2.1 per cent and households using an electric or hybrid-electric vehicle increased from less than 1 per cent to 2.8 per cent, reflecting the growing adoption of LCTs nationally.",
