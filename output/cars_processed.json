    "published_date": "2025-05-29T15:06:00",
    "content": "Sunday\u2019s 109th running of the Indy 500 saw Alex Palou win his fifth race of the season, a feat made even more impressive by the fact that the iconic Memorial Day weekend race was just the sixth race of the 2025 calendar. It was also the Spaniard\u2019s first-ever oval win, further emphasizing the dreamy season Chip Ganassi\u2019s new star is having so far. But amid all the Palou headlines, there\u2019s an element that\u2019s often less talked about: the Honda hybrid engine that made it possible. When the bright-yellow, DHL-sponsored Honda crossed the yard of bricks ahead of its competitors Sunday, it wasn\u2019t a coincidence. It was months, if not a full year of preparation by the No. 10 crew, but primarily, lots of practice during the month of May. Besides the usual challenges of running in a pack, drafting, turbulence, dealing with slower traffic, pit stops, and everything else that makes racing at 230 mph for nearly three hours a monumental challenge, there was a new layer to be concerned about this year. See, this year\u2019s sold-out race was the first time the entire 33-car grid, Chevy or Honda, ran a spec hybrid system. And like everything else in racing, teams and drivers alike have had to learn how to use it to their advantage. Travis Hinkle A Long Time Coming It took IndyCar a long time to fulfill its promise to go hybrid \u2014nearly five years, actually. Developmental delays, followed by manufacturing and shipping delays, resulted in a series of postponements that left everyone wondering if it would ever arrive. And when the pandemic of 2020 brought global chaos and the world came to a standstill, many wondered if it would even happen at all. But alas, nearly halfway through the 2024 season, IndyCar went racing with all-new hybrid systems at the Mid-Ohio Sports Car Course. While this may be the first hybrid 500, it doesn\u2019t mean teams went into the race completely blind. As Kelvin Fu, HRC US Vice President (and a real engineering wizard), explained to me the morning of the race, there\u2019s been lots of model simulation and racing simulator work to optimize the system\u2019s performance. While HRC US\u2014Honda\u2019s racing branch in North America\u2014provides plenty of support to its IndyCar teams, the ultimate application of the car\u2019s drivetrain and other systems completely depends on the team. Furthermore, with both Honda and Chevy engines running the same hybrid and energy storage systems, the biggest challenge for the drivers is learning how to tame them and maximize their benefits, which is something they haven\u2019t had much time to figure out at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. Joe Skibinski, Matt Favrer \u201cIn terms of preparation of the hybrid system, it all really works together as it\u2019s integrated into the engine and chassis, etc,\u201d Fu explained. \u201cSo it\u2019s more simulation and situational preparation ahead of the 500. It\u2019s a lot more trying to understand how the drivers can deploy the energy, as they\u2019re already doing many things with the tools on their steering wheels, so that\u2019s a challenge for them. Traditionally, drivers don\u2019t want to be the first guy [at the front of the pack], but that may change. Drivers have to figure out moving around the pack and multiple strategies\u2026 [the new system brings] something different, and it forces teams and drivers to handle change. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be interesting [during the race], and we won\u2019t know until it runs. Our assumption is that as you\u2019re racing, the drivers who are better at harvesting and regenerating at the right time are going to slowly have an advantage as they go around. The ability to regen is going to be affected by where they are in the pack. If you are in the front, there\u2019s less lifting [off the throttle], but as you fall back there\u2019s [more lifting], and when you are lifting that\u2019s when you are regenerating,\u201d added Fu. \u201cThose guys might be able to build more energy, so they\u2019ll have a better chance of passing. We\u2019ll see how it goes, a lot of things can affect how the cars run\u2014the cooler weather, downforce, etc. We think the hybrid system will have an effect on how effectively they can pass\u2014the drivers and teams who can figure out the system better will move through the field easier.\u201d Overall race-pace speeds weren\u2019t dramatically affected by the higher power of the hybrid\u2014a combined 900 hp\u2014as the car is about 100 pounds heavier than before. The system itself is housed alongside the engine and is about the size of a milk crate, making the packaging under the engine cover a bigger challenge than in previous years. And contrary to popular belief, it hasn\u2019t made the engines more fuel efficient either. It\u2019s 100% about power and performance. Joe Skibinski, Chris Owens Fu\u2019s comments about the system favoring savvy drivers who do their homework resonated as the laps racked up during Sunday\u2019s race. Palou, who started sixth, was never quite in the mix at the front for most of the race. In fact, it wasn\u2019t until about lap 180 of 200 that he made his intentions extremely clear with a couple of aggressive passes on Chevy drivers Santino Ferrucci and Pato O\u2019Ward. Prior to that, Palou was running steady within the top 10 or 12, managing his fuel strategy, making clean pit stops, and more importantly, avoiding chaos. Over the course of 480-plus miles, Palou (along with everyone else) managed their energy harvesting and power output to up the pace when necessary, and go for crucial passes when needed. And little by little, the Spaniard positioned himself just right at the end of the race. He methodically did what he had to do to be within striking distance when it mattered most. Honda would not comment on Palou\u2019s specific management of the hybrid system during the race, but it curiously highlighted that during qualifying, data revealed that many drivers\u2019 speeds during the fourth and final lap of Indy\u2019s four-lap-average qualifying format were often the fastest. It\u2019s usually the other way around as the tires begin to scrub, the engines begin to overheat from being turned to 11, and drivers begin to overthink and overcorrect. This year, however, drivers were harvesting during the first three and deploying that additional energy on the fourth lap. Surely, those same strategies were put into place on race day. Joe Skibinski Back to the Front Between 2004 and 2014, Chevy only managed to steal one Indy 500 win away from Honda. Since then, however, it\u2019s been just about an even split between IndyCar\u2019s two engine manufacturers. And after back-to-back Penske-Chevy wins at the hands of Josef Newgarden in 2023 and 2024 ( one of those with a car of questionable legality ), Honda\u2019s sweep of the 2025 season so far highlights its engineering prowess\u2014even when it comes to non-proprietary systems. And almost equally as important as winning is the fact that the hybrid components worked exactly as expected, and there were no hybrid failures or issues during the race in Honda-powered cars. To place first, you first have to finish the race. When asked about any tweaks or further developments Honda would like to make to the hybrid system for next year, Fu highlighted that there have been some improvements since its debut, but so far, they\u2019re pretty happy where things are at. \u201cHonda makes the super capacitor, and Chevy Ilmore makes the MGU, but it\u2019s really IndyCar\u2019s system,\u201d said Fu. \u201cIt\u2019s a combined effort between manufacturers that\u2019s been good so far. We\u2019ll propose improvements and other things, but there\u2019s always a trade-off to making changes\u2026 as those things require costs, time, things need to be tested and validated, etc. Of course, Honda is always looking to make improvements, and this year we\u2019ve already been able to increase the energy allowance. \u201cOverall, it\u2019s a good system right now, and we don\u2019t want to change it too much in the near future.\u201d Chris Owens CHRIS OWENS Got a tip?

    "content": "The UK government needs to go beyond offering subsidies for low-carbon technologies (LCTs) like electric cars and solar panels for energy and heating, if it is to meet its net-zero targets by 2050, a new report from the University of Sheffield suggests. The report, published with partners from the universities of Nottingham and Macedonia, found that although gains are being made in encouraging people to adopt low-carbon technologies, not enough is being done to continue to reduce the inequalities in uptake amongst some socioeconomic groups. In recent years households using solar panels for electricity generation has increased from 3 to 6.5 per cent, the adoption of solar panels being used for heating increased from 1.4 to 2.1 per cent and households using an electric or hybrid-electric vehicle increased from less than 1 per cent to 2.8 per cent, reflecting the growing adoption of LCTs nationally. However, the study found that although socioeconomic inequalities in LCTs adoption have decreased over the past decade, they still persist. Factors such as age, education, occupation, ethnicity and gender all contribute directly and indirectly to people's ability to invest in LCTs. The report authors say more needs to be done to level the playing field, and help those from more disadvantaged backgrounds adopt technologies that could lower their household bills, and contribute to the UK's decarbonisation in the housing and automotive sectors. Dr Andrew Burlinson, from the University of Sheffield's School of Economics, said: \"Our research suggests that some socioeconomic groups have not been adequately supported to adopt LCTs. So it is important to emphasise that by limiting the ability of the most disadvantaged groups to invest in technology that can lower their bills and increase resilience to fluctuating living costs -- such as current high energy prices -- may further exacerbate broader inequalities in our society. \"Our analysis reveals that educated and affluent households are more likely to have been able to adopt low-carbon technologies early, such as solar energy, solar heating and electric or hybrid transport. \"Yet some existing financial subsidies to help people transition to LCTs have now ended, so those members of society who were unable to become early-adopters are now being left behind in the transition to net-zero.\" The UK government currently subsidises the purchase of some types of electric vehicles at the point of sale, but these subsidies are largely independent of the socioeconomic status of the consumer. Alongside this, subsidies to install domestic solar panels ended in 2019, which means that incentives to help people adopt LCTs are now limited, and may be working less well for those members of society with a lower socioeconomic status. The authors say exploring the presence of socioeconomic inequalities in LCTs in the UK has important policy implications for the low-carbon transition, and the achievements of the UK government's ambitious and legally binding environmental targets. There are positive signs that some consumers are increasingly adopting more sustainable ways to live and travel. But the Climate Change Committee reports that for the UK to make significant gains in reaching its net-zero targets, the market share for new electric vehicles needs to be at 100 per cent, from only 16.5 per cent today, and that solar panel installation rates need to increase by five times that of current levels. Professor Monica Giulietti, from the University of Nottingham, said: \"In our report and new policy brief, we suggest it is vital that new interventions should be targeted towards those groups that could potentially benefit the most from cost-reducing technologies, not just at individual level but at a community level as well. This action will rely on addressing policy gaps in the private, rented and social housing sectors.\" As well as more targeted financial incentives for those of a lower socioeconomic position, the report calls for information incentives provided by trusted organisations to establish educational guidance and increase awareness of LCTs; to help those most in need navigate decision making about adoption. The report also argues that new interventions need to be made at community level. Rather than advocating for solar technology just for individual households, a shift towards community installations is suggested to help alleviate the cost burden of adoption, and help level the playing field for those who do not have individual control over their property or transport. Commenting on the research, Dr Jayne Carrick, from the South Yorkshire Sustainability Centre, said: \"A recent survey conducted by the South Yorkshire Sustainability Centre into the region's energy consumption habits revealed a significant hurdle to low-carbon technologies: 46 per cent of residents are reluctant to adopt solar panels, and 57 per cent are hesitant about heat pumps. \"Much more needs to be done in UK policy to address the inequality in uptake and beyond. For example, the opportunity to unlock the power of community energy initiatives is a crucial area, streamlining processes and fostering collective investment to make LCTs accessible for all.\" Dr Andrew Burlinson added: \"The findings of the new report add to the growing debate on the low individual uptake of LCTs, and the problems created for consumers from more disadvantaged backgrounds when access to the benefits of low-carbon technologies is unequally distributed. \"Our results lead us to support policies targeting specific socioeconomic groups at individual and community level, which is not only crucial to mitigate the observed inequalities in LCT adoption, but also relevant in promoting energy efficiency and resilience to high energy prices as we transition towards a low-carbon future.\"",
