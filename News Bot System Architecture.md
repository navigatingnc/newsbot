# News Bot System Architecture

## Overview

The News Bot is a modular, replicable system designed to scrape news from various sources, summarize content, generate related questions and images, and post to multiple social media platforms and forums. The system is built using an open-source stack and is designed to be easily configurable through a user interface.

## System Components

### 1. User Interface (UI)
- **Topic Configuration**: Interface for users to define news topics of interest
- **Destination Selection**: Interface to select which platforms to post to
- **Scheduling**: Configuration for daily scraping and posting schedule
- **Bot Management**: Interface to create, manage, and replicate bots

### 2. News Scraper Module
- **Google Search Integration**: Scrapes news from Google search results
- **Website Scraper**: Extracts content from specific websites
- **RSS Feed Parser**: Parses RSS feeds for news content
- **Source Manager**: Manages and prioritizes different news sources

### 3. Content Processor
- **Text Summarizer**: Creates concise summaries of news articles
- **Question Generator**: Generates relevant questions based on article content
- **Content Formatter**: Formats content for different platforms

### 4. Image Generator
- **Topic Analyzer**: Analyzes news content to determine image subject
- **Image Creator**: Generates relevant images for news topics
- **Image Optimizer**: Optimizes images for different platforms

### 5. Social Media Poster
- **Platform Connectors**: Interfaces with various social media APIs
  - X (Twitter) Connector
  - Reddit Connector
  - Instagram Connector
  - Self-hosted Forum Connector
- **Post Scheduler**: Manages timing of posts
- **Post Monitor**: Tracks posting success and failures

### 6. Data Storage
- **Configuration Storage**: Stores bot configurations
- **Content Database**: Stores scraped and processed content
- **Posting History**: Tracks what has been posted where

### 7. Scheduler
- **Daily Job Manager**: Manages daily scraping and posting tasks
- **Error Recovery**: Handles failures and retries

## Data Flow

1. User configures bot topics and destinations through UI
2. Scheduler triggers daily scraping job
3. News Scraper collects relevant articles from configured sources
4. Content Processor summarizes articles and generates questions
5. Image Generator creates relevant images for each article
6. Social Media Poster formats and posts content to selected platforms
7. Results are stored in the database and displayed in the UI

## Technology Stack

### Backend
- **Python**: Core programming language
- **FastAPI**: API framework for the backend
- **BeautifulSoup/Scrapy**: Web scraping
- **NLTK/spaCy**: Natural language processing for summarization
- **SQLite/PostgreSQL**: Data storage
- **APScheduler**: Task scheduling

### Frontend
- **React**: UI framework
- **Material-UI**: Component library
- **Axios**: API communication

### Image Generation
- **Pillow**: Image processing
- **OpenCV**: Computer vision capabilities

### Deployment
- **Docker**: Containerization
- **Docker Compose**: Multi-container orchestration

## API Interfaces

### Internal APIs

1. **Scraper API**
   - `GET /api/scrape/{topic}`: Scrape news for a specific topic
   - `GET /api/sources`: List available news sources
   - `POST /api/sources`: Add a new news source

2. **Processor API**
   - `POST /api/summarize`: Summarize article content
   - `POST /api/generate-question`: Generate a question based on content

3. **Image API**
   - `POST /api/generate-image`: Generate an image for a news topic

4. **Poster API**
   - `POST /api/post`: Post content to selected platforms
   - `GET /api/platforms`: List available platforms
   - `GET /api/post-history`: Get posting history

5. **Bot API**
   - `GET /api/bots`: List all configured bots
   - `POST /api/bots`: Create a new bot
   - `GET /api/bots/{id}`: Get bot details
   - `PUT /api/bots/{id}`: Update bot configuration
   - `DELETE /api/bots/{id}`: Delete a bot
   - `POST /api/bots/{id}/clone`: Clone an existing bot

### External APIs

1. **Social Media Platform APIs**
   - X (Twitter) API
   - Reddit API
   - Instagram API
   - Custom forum API endpoints

## Replication and Scalability

The system is designed to be easily replicable, allowing users to create multiple bots with different configurations. Each bot instance can:

- Track different topics
- Post to different platforms
- Run on different schedules
- Use different summarization styles

The modular architecture ensures that new sources and platforms can be added with minimal changes to the core system.

## Security Considerations

- API keys and credentials are stored securely
- Rate limiting is implemented to prevent API abuse
- Input validation to prevent injection attacks
- Proper error handling and logging

## Future Extensibility

The architecture is designed to allow for future enhancements:
- Additional news sources
- New social media platforms
- Enhanced summarization algorithms
- More sophisticated image generation
- Analytics and performance tracking
